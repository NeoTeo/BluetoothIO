/** Pass in:
 Peripheral name
 uuids for service and characteristics of interest
 handler for received data
 
 Peripheral
 service
 characteristic
 characteristic
 service
 characteristic
 
 the handler could, async'ly, add new data to a a queue that the main app
 can dequeue and deal with. Or just deal with it there...but that gives less
 control (eg. to discard all but last item in queue)
 
 Each service can have multiple characteristics so we need to associate them.
 We should bundle a characteristic and its handler when we pass it to this so
 that we can call the correct handler.
 
 The handler has to know which service a particular characteristic comes from.
 Because each service has its own characteristics it should be associated with
 Service->characteristic1->handler1
 characteristic2->handler2
